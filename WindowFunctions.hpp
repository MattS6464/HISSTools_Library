 * @file [YourFileName.hpp]  // Replace with the actual file name
 * @brief Provides a collection of window functions and utilities for signal processing.
 *
 * This file contains implementations of various window functions used in signal processing to reduce spectral leakage,
 * such as the Hann, Hamming, Blackman, and Nuttall windows. It also provides flat-top window variants and more advanced
 * window functions like Kaiser and cosine windows. These functions are used to generate window values for a given signal
 * over a specified range of indices.
 *
 * In addition to the window functions, the file defines a flexible and extensible framework for selecting and applying
 * different window generators dynamically using indexed generators and template programming.
 *
 * The main components of this file include:
 * - Definitions of `params` struct for parameterizing window functions.
 * - Template-based window generators for different types of windows.
 * - Utilities for managing multiple window generators, such as `indexed_generator`.
 *
 * The window functions provided in this file are widely used in signal processing, especially in spectral analysis, filter design,
 * and applications that require minimizing spectral leakage while preserving amplitude accuracy.
 *
 * @note Ensure that the appropriate template parameters are used when selecting and applying window functions.
